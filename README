PDBC

The PDBC module provides a higher-level interface to the JDBC module.
(The JDBC module provides an interface to Java JDBC using Inline::Java.)
Specifically it provides a more DBI-like interface for JDBC.
The goal is for PDBC to define the DBI<->DBD API.

You'll need to install and test JDBC before you can use this module.

INSTALLATION
