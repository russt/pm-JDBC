JDBC

The JDBC module provides an interface to Java JDBC using Inline::Java.

You'll need to install and test Inline::Java (>= 0.50) before you can use this module.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Unless you have org.apache.derby.jdbc already in your CLASSPATH you'll need to
modify your CLASSPATH environment variable to include the Derby pure-java
database driver because that's what the tests use.

The Derby database driver is bundled with the JDBC module in the drivers
directory. You can set your CLASSPATH environment variable to include the
full path to the drivers/db-derby-10.1.1.0.jar file.
