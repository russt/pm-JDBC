JDBC

The JDBC module provides an interface to Java JDBC using Inline::Java.

You'll need to install and test Inline::Java (>= 0.50) before you can use this module.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

The Derby database driver is bundled with the JDBC module in the drivers
directory. The t/test_init.pl script is used by all the tests to add
the full path to the drivers/db-derby-10.1.1.0.jar file into CLASSPATH for you.

(Alternatively you can hack t/test_init.pl to refer to some other driver, but
then it'll be much harder for people to help you if you run into problems.)
